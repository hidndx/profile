#### <h2>HTML/CSS templates, definition and usage.</h2>
A HTML/CSS Template is a pre-designed layout that will help you build a final website. HTML <strong>( HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the basic coding to create web pages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it's used to define and style the HTML elements.

To install a HTML/CSS template requires just to copy the template files on your webserver. This can be done using your hosting provider custom interface or a FTP (File Transfer Protocol) software. Our recommandation is FileZilla.

A regular HTML/CSS template does NOT include a CMS (Content Management System) to edit/add content of the pages. All content is edited using a HTML editor. HTML editors can be found as free and paid editors. Some modern HTML editors have included a DESIGN view mode of the code, making it easier for templates to be edited. Regular ones will let you edit the content only from the code mode, meaning you will need to have a basic HTML coding knowledge.<br>

#### <h2>Most of the pages will start with the following HTML code</h2>

```
<!-- Overlay panel -->
<div class="body-overlay"></div>
<!-- Left panel -->
<div id="panel-left"></div>
<!-- Right panel -->
<div id="panel-right"></div>
```
The body overlay div will be used to show a black transparent overlay when the rigth or left panel is open.

The main content will start with the DIV "<div class="page page--main" data-page="main">". Each page has an unique ID called with "data-page="main". This ID will be used in jQuery code to add some extra functionality to this page only.<hr>
